# BtW Importer

**BtW Importer** migrates your Blogger/Blogspot content to WordPress with a single click using your `.atom` file.

A powerful yet simple migration tool, BtW Importer helps you seamlessly transfer posts, images, and formatting from Blogger (Blogspot) to WordPress. Whether you're a casual blogger or managing a large archive, this plugin handles the complex parts so you don’t have to.

## ⚔️ Note
Make sure to check your content after you import contents. Also, this plugin doesn't overwrite current post or pages, so if you've imported posts or pages and want to import again, kindly delete the previous imported posts, pages, and images.
