BtW Importer migrates your Blogger/Blogspot content to WordPress with a single click using your .atom file.

== Description ==
BtW Importer is a powerful yet simple migration tool that helps you seamlessly transfer your content from Blogger (Blogspot) to WordPress with minimal effort. Whether you're a casual blogger or managing a large archive, this plugin handles the complex parts so you don’t have to.

With just one click, BtW Importer lets you upload your .atom file from Google Takeout and automatically imports your posts—images, links, formatting, and more. It also enhances your content by downloading embedded images, replacing Blogger URLs with WordPress-friendly links, and setting featured images based on the first image in each post. Plus, you’ll get real-time progress feedback so you can watch the migration unfold with confidence.

Designed to be fast, reliable, and compatible with WordPress 6.8+, this plugin streamlines the process and saves you hours of manual work.

== Features ==

* Scans and downloads embedded images  
* Replaces outdated Blogger URLs with WordPress-friendly links  
* Sets featured images using the first image in each post  
* Displays real-time progress during import  
* Supports image formats: `jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, svg, tiff, avif, ico`. Undownloaded images and videos still embedded, but with external files.  
* Import content based on post type  
* Keep external embedded content  
* Posts or Pages date sync as date in the .atom file (e.g. your Blogspot post published on 2022/02/02, then the post in WordPress also 2022/02/02)  
* Categories added or use existing category based on .atom file  
* Only Blogspot/Google images downloaded, others external (saving your hosting storage, especially if you use external CDN)  
* Only download original size images (avoid duplicated)  
* Automatically add 301 redirect from Blogspot permalink to new WordPress URL to keep your SEO (only for post with `/YYYY/MM/slug.html` format)  
* Redirect log page to check list of redirection has been made, also option to clear redirection logs
