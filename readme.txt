BtW Importer migrates your Blogger/Blogspot content to WordPress with a single click using your .atom file.

== Description ==
BtW Importer is a powerful yet simple migration tool that helps you seamlessly transfer your content from Blogger (Blogspot) to WordPress with minimal effort. Whether you're a casual blogger or managing a large archive, this plugin handles the complex parts so you donâ€™t have to.

With just one click, BtW Importer lets you upload your .atom file from Google Takeout and automatically imports your postsâ€”images, links, formatting, and more. It also enhances your content by downloading embedded images, replacing Blogger URLs with WordPress-friendly links, and setting featured images based on the first image in each post. Plus, youâ€™ll get real-time progress feedback so you can watch the migration unfold with confidence.

Designed to be fast, reliable, and compatible with WordPress 6.8+, this plugin streamlines the process and saves you hours of manual work.

== Features ==

* Scans and downloads embedded images  
* Replaces outdated Blogger URLs with WordPress-friendly links  
* Sets featured images using the first image in each post  
* Displays real-time progress during import  
* Supports image formats: `jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, svg, tiff, avif, ico`. Undownloaded images and videos still embedded, but with external files.  
* Import content based on post type  
* Keep external embedded content  
* Posts or Pages date sync as date in the .atom file (e.g. your Blogspot post published on 2022/02/02, then the post in WordPress also 2022/02/02)  
* Categories added or use existing category based on .atom file  
* Only Blogspot/Google images downloaded, others external (saving your hosting storage, especially if you use external CDN)  
* Only download original size images (avoid duplicated)  
* Automatically add 301 redirect from Blogspot permalink to new WordPress URL to keep your SEO (only for post with `/YYYY/MM/slug.html` format)  
* Redirect log page to check list of redirection has been made, also option to clear redirection logs
